# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The puropse of this project is to have an online source where people can quickly look up various UFO sighting by using multiple filters. 

## Results: 
The user can easily search the data base for UF sightings based on known information such as date, city, state, country, and even shape of the UFO. The user will enter the information they have in one of the five filter boxes and the search results will automatically populate.

## Summary:
While this provides very basic information about UFO sightings, there's not a lot of detailed information or links to outiside websites where the user could follow for further research. I would add links to further information from outside websites such as the newspaper article descibing the event. I would also add functionality for the user to select and compare events and the ability to export the data easily from the website.
