# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The puropse of this project is to have an online source where people can quickly look up various UFO sighting by using multiple filters. 

## Results: 
The user can easily search the data base for UF sightings based on known information such as date, city, state, country, and even shape of the UFO. The user will enter the information they have in one of the five filter boxes and the search results will automatically populate.

While this provides very basic information about UFO sightings, there's not a lot of detailed information or links to outiside websights where the user could follow for further research. 


## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
